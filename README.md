# Churn-Analysis-Project

This project conducts a comprehensive churn analysis on bank customer data using Power BI Desktop. We explore various factors that might influence customer retention, including demographics (gender, age), financial products used, credit scores, account balances, and more. Through detailed visualizations, we uncover patterns that help identify the key drivers of customer churn. Our findings aim to assist in developing targeted strategies to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.

## Highlights

- **Demographic Insights:** Analysis of customer distribution by gender, age, and country.
- **Financial Behaviors:** Examination of product usage, credit card ownership, and account balance impacts.
- **Churn Trends:** Identification of churn rates across different customer segments.
- **Actionable Insights:** Recommendations for targeted customer retention strategies.

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in uncovering actionable insights from complex datasets, providing a foundation for data-driven decision-making in customer relationship management.
